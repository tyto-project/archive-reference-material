# Provenance — `archive/`

Every corpus here is copied and maintained by this project, because its upstream is disappearing
or is deleting the parts Ethereum Classic depends on. Pins to live upstreams live in
`../upstream/PROVENANCE.md` instead.

**Two postures, chosen by what would be lost if the upstream vanished tomorrow.**

## `etclabscore/tests/` — full vendor, full history

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/etclabscore/tests` |
| branch | `main` |
| ref | `06ec708ea7` |
| upstream date | 2023-08-25 |
| vendored | 2026-08-21 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 3,182 commits |
| contents | 9,296 files · 8,728 json · 934 MB |

**Verified at vendoring:** file and json counts match the source exactly, `GeneralStateTests/`
compares byte-identical, and `06ec708ea7` is addressable here.

### Why all of it, and why the history

The upstream is scheduled for deprecation, so **every part of it is at risk** — including the
history, which is the only record of how the ETC labels were produced. It is also a **live build
dependency of the production Ethereum Classic client**, which consumes it as a submodule, so its
removal breaks a running conformance suite rather than merely an archive.

### Frozen at `06ec708ea7` — and here is how to prove it

This corpus is **not maintained here**. It is the upstream state at that ref and stays that way.

**Check it by tree hash, not by diff.** `git subtree` relocates the corpus under a prefix, so
`git diff <ref>..HEAD -- <path>` compares upstream's root-level paths against our prefixed ones
and reports every file as added. That command reads like a freeze check and is not one — it
returned "9,298 files changed" against an archive that had never been touched.

Compare the trees directly instead:

```sh
git rev-parse '06ec708ea7^{tree}'
git rev-parse 'HEAD:archive/etclabscore/tests'
```

**Two identical hashes is the whole proof** — the archive is bit-for-bit upstream's tree. Verified
2026-08-21: both are `4f98c5a20296d80639bf64c7897a85d5897f2bc1`.

If they ever differ, something edited the archive. That is a defect to revert, not a change to
review.

Gaps and inherited mistakes are answered in the Tyto suite outside `archived/`, never by
editing these files.

### Known defects, measured 2026-08-21 — preserved as published, NOT corrected

The ETC fork labels were produced by a text substitution (`makeetc.sh`) over Ethereum fixtures.
**Renaming a label does not change the EIP bundle inside the fixture.**

| label | files | derived from | sound? |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `ETC_Phoenix` | 7,469 | Istanbul | yes — equivalent bundle |
| `ETC_Magneto` | 5,301 | Berlin | yes — the client calls it equivalent |
| `ETC_Agharta` | 96 | Constantinople+Fix | probably |
| `ETC_Atlantis` | 90 | Byzantium | **no** — bundle divergence |
| `ETC_Mystique` | 5,496 | London | **no** — bundle divergence |
| `ETC_Spiral` | ~0 | — | **absent** — current mainnet has no coverage |

The sharpest defect: `Merge` was renamed onto `ETC_Mystique` at scale, and Merge-labelled blocks
carry proof-of-stake semantics — `difficulty: 0x00`, zeroed `mixHash`, zero `nonce`. **Those
fixtures assert that a difficulty-0 block is valid. On a proof-of-work chain it is not.**

See `../networks/` for the mapping that supersedes these labels. Read rule sets from the
production client, never from a rendered specification.

### Easy to lose

`etclabscore/tests/src-etc/` — 24 filler files including `stChainId`. The only **ETC-authored**
test source that exists upstream, as opposed to renamed Ethereum material.

## `ethereum/tests/` — extraction, a subset

**Not a mirror.** Upstream is alive and pinned at `../upstream/ethereum/tests`; only material no
upstream will hold is copied here.

4,266 files, 62 MB, drawn from **two refs**, because purged material can only be read from a
commit before its purge.

`ethereum/EXTRACTION.md` is the authority: each path, its source ref, the reason, and the commands
to re-derive and verify it.

### Why a subset here and everything there

`etclabscore` is dying, so all of it is at risk. `ethereum/tests` is not — a non-shallow clone at
the pin carries upstream's full history, purged files included. Copying it wholesale would spend
hundreds of megabytes to preserve what a pin already reaches.

What the pin cannot survive is deletion, a history rewrite, or a shallow clone — and it cannot
make purged material discoverable. That is what is extracted, and nothing more.

# The Ethereum Classic client lineage — vendored whole, 2026-08-24

**Eleven repositories, whole, with history.** Operator decision: this chain's clients are the
record of its eras. Ethereum has had one client present throughout; Ethereum Classic has had
core-dev churn — Classic Geth, then Parity, then multi-geth, then core-geth, and now Tyto — and
an extraction cannot show how a client changed across an era.

**Mechanism:** `git subtree add` without `--squash`, from a local clone at the named ref. Every
one is verified by TREE HASH against its source — `git rev-parse '<ref>^{tree}'` equals
`git rev-parse 'HEAD:archive/<prefix>'` for all eleven. A diff proves nothing here, because
subtree relocates the corpus under a prefix and reports every file as added.

**Totals:** 65,506 commits, 44,830 files, 1,794 MB.

**Nothing exceeds GitHub's 100 MB per-file limit** — checked across every object in every
vendored history before any of it landed, largest 62.0 MB. That check is not optional: grafted
history is permanent, and one oversized blob would make this repository unpushable forever.


## `ethereumproject/go-ethereum/`

| upstream | `https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 9,605 commits |
| contents | 1,439 files · 329 MB |

Classic Geth — the ORIGINAL Ethereum Classic client, and the first link in this chain's client lineage. It carried the network from the 2016 split until core-geth. **Its entire GitHub organization is archived — all 44 repositories — so nothing upstream is maintained and the repository is read-only.** `master` is its ETC-supporting state: unlike Parity and multi-geth, this client never dropped the chain, it was retired with it.


## `ethereumproject/tests/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/ethereumproject/tests` |
| ref | `EIP150` @ `c0525403872fe3eb50f13500184dff1b8256395f` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 908 commits |
| contents | 802 files · 281 MB |

The original Ethereum Classic common test suite. **Frozen on branch `EIP150`, not `master`** — that is the branch the repository was left on, and taking `master` here would answer a different question. Org archived.


## `ethereumproject/parity/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/ethereumproject/parity` |
| ref | `master` @ `92466a7d6689900b28dce566afbbddd87b2bbe95` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 8,787 commits |
| contents | 2,552 files · 15 MB |

Ethereum Classic's own fork of Parity, distinct from `openethereum/parity-ethereum` which is the upstream lineage. Org archived.


## `openethereum/parity-ethereum/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum` |
| ref | `etc-frozen` @ `55c90d4016505317034e3e98f699af07f5404b63` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 12,342 commits |
| contents | 1,029 files · 13 MB |

Parity at its last Ethereum Classic-supporting state. **The repository is archived on GitHub** (2020-11-01). Supersedes the nine-file extraction previously held at this path — every one of those blobs is byte-identical inside this vendor, verified before the extraction was cleared.


## `openethereum/parity-ethereum-dao/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/openethereum/parity-ethereum-dao` |
| ref | `dao-frozen` @ `2cf4549d0181ad1d60fbd3bbe132b599a14a8965` |
| upstream date | 2016-07-16 |
| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 4,749 commits |
| contents | 538 files · 4 MB |

The same repository at the DAO fork. **This ref is not an ancestor of the one above** — they share root `f7b618cec` and diverge — so vendoring one does not preserve the other. It is the source of `frontier-dogmatic.json`, which sits beside `frontier.json` differing only by the removed `daoHardfork*` block: the declining chain expressed as a config diff, and this suite's fork-identifier primary source.


## `multi-geth/multi-geth/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/multi-geth/multi-geth` |
| ref | `etc-frozen` @ `38865665e94b14d4e9595478789b5d15f925003b` |
| upstream date | 2021-02-27 |
| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 12,704 commits |
| contents | 1,567 files · 33 MB |

The client between Parity and core-geth. Supersedes the eleven-file extraction previously held at this path, verified byte-identical first. Shares root commit `5db3335dc` with core-geth — **one lineage under two names, never a second oracle.**


## `multi-geth/tests/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/multi-geth/tests` |
| ref | `develop` @ `784ff964111cf1e1d2d52db0cfd06796bd03321c` |
| upstream date | 2019-06-09 |
| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 2,176 commits |
| contents | 28,279 files · 723 MB |

The multi-geth-era cross-client suite, described upstream as an unfork of `ethereum/tests`. Dormant since 2019 with no stars. The largest entry in this pass at 723 MB and 28,279 files.


## `ethereum/go-ethereum-dao/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum-dao` |
| ref | `pre-dao` @ `b7e3dfc5a2bc7e2f4d653fbe0ec9774277a10643` |
| upstream date | 2016-06-29 |
| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 7,413 commits |
| contents | 2,121 files · 330 MB |

go-ethereum immediately before the DAO fork: the last state both chains share, and therefore the strongest oracle available for Frontier and Homestead — before the split there is no such thing as Ethereum's implementation as against this chain's. The upstream is in no danger; this is held for the ERA, not for preservation.


## `besu-eth/besu-etc/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/besu-eth/besu-etc` |
| ref | `etc-frozen` @ `eb4248c997cb79cc88db55ead562081a43721a3b` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 6,443 commits |
| contents | 5,973 files · 61 MB |

Besu's Ethereum Classic support. **The upstream is a fork organization, not Hyperledger** — `besu-eth/besu` — and the ETC material appears nowhere in `hyperledger/besu`. The org is active, so this is vendored against fork-org risk rather than dormancy. A third independent lineage: root `7dfc2e408`, sharing no commit with geth or Parity, and this suite's third oracle for the difficulty rules. Its ETC surface is six files; a token search for `ecip1010` finds none of them, because the rule lives in `ClassicDifficultyCalculators`.


## `etclabscore/hive/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/etclabscore/hive` |
| ref | `master` @ `dd1a8a2d6b3424c102cc66418e8af01b6a0c043a` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 378 commits |
| contents | 528 files · 5 MB |

The Ethereum Classic fork of the end-to-end test harness. Distinct from `ethereum/hive`, which is held here as an extraction.


## `etclabscore/goldset/`

| field | value |
|---|---|
| upstream | `https://github.com/etclabscore/goldset` |
| ref | `master` @ `2a3514bc8eddfaf6251e2a9530afd17744aa893d` |

| vendored | 2026-08-24 |
| mechanism | `git subtree add`, **full history** — 1 commits |
| contents | 2 files · 0 MB |

"Goldset For Testing Historical Results against Live ETC network." A single commit, two files — small enough that its value is entirely in not losing it.

# Ethereum Classic tooling and personal-account work — vendored 2026-08-26

**Twenty-nine repositories, whole, with history**, plus one extraction. Selected against this
archive's own test: what disappears if the upstream vanishes tomorrow.

Three groups, and the reason differs by group:

- **`etclabscore/`** — that organization is scheduled for deprecation, so its Ethereum
  Classic-specific repositories are the clearest instance of the test.
- **`iquidus/`** — the author of ECIP-1099. The Etchash implementation work lives in that
  account's **forks**, not in the upstreams they were forked from, so vendoring the upstream
  would preserve the wrong thing.
- **`meowsbits/`** — the author of ECIP-1100. **Eight of the vendored trees across these groups
  ship no license file at all**, and several carry zero forks upstream; GitHub preserves a
  deleted repository's forks, so a zero-fork personal repository has nothing to survive it.

Both authors have left the Ethereum Classic ecosystem.

**Deliberately excluded**, because they fail the test rather than because they lack value:
`iquidus/explorer` (737 stars, BSD-3-Clause, widely forked, not Ethereum Classic-specific),
`iquidus/blockspider` (a general blockchain crawler), and the live `diega/*` repositories.
`meowsbits/geth-prometheus` was checked and is an **empty repository** with zero refs.

Every entry is verified by TREE HASH against its source clone, with a control confirming the
comparison can report a mismatch. `meowsbits/EXTRACTION.md` covers the gists and documents.

The epoch-transition research behind ECIP-1099, by that proposal's author.

**Its `ETCHASH_FORK_BLOCK=11460000` is NOT an error, and must not be recorded as one.**
`MAINNET.md` was written 2020-09-14. core-geth defined the mainnet activation as
`11_700_000` on 2020-09-25, eleven days later, and `11460000` never appears in
core-geth's params at any point in its history. Both values are epoch-aligned under
both the old 30,000 and new 60,000 epoch lengths (11,460,000 = epoch 382 / 191;
11,700,000 = epoch 390 / 195); the difference is exactly 8 old epochs, roughly 38
days of additional lead time. This is a **superseded pre-decisional working value**,
recorded before the activation block was chosen, and it is preserved as published.
Read activation blocks from the production client, never from this file.

# Two further implementations of the shared chain — vendored 2026-08-27

**Two repositories, whole, with history**, added on different grounds — which is why both entries
below need reading rather than one standing in for the other. `ethereum/ethereumj` is a historic
Ethereum Classic client and enters on this archive's usual test: what disappears if the upstream
vanishes tomorrow. `ethereum/aleth` has **zero** Ethereum Classic support and does not meet that
test at all. It is held for the ERA, on exactly the ground `ethereum/go-ethereum-dao` above states.

**Neither is a pin in `../upstream/`, and the reason is the same for both: both upstreams are
archived on GitHub.** That tree holds pins on LIVE upstreams, where tracking beats copying because
a copy would only drift. There is nothing here left to track and no drift left to avoid, and a pin
on a dead repository still leaves a `.gitmodules` URL that dies if the repository ever does.

Both are verified by TREE HASH against their source clones, with a control confirming the
comparison can report a mismatch, and both were swept for oversized blobs across their whole
histories before either landed — the sweep calibrated at 1 MiB first, so that an empty result at
100 MiB meant "none" rather than "the check is blind."

The C++ client — one of the original implementations of the shared chain, and the C++ record of it
from Frontier through the DAO fork. Its history runs 2013-12-23 to 2021-10-28, and its final commit
is a deprecation merge. **The upstream is archived but in no danger; this is held for the ERA, not
for preservation** — the same ground `ethereum/go-ethereum-dao` is held on.

**Unlike the two `-dao` entries above, this is not a fork-era snapshot.** `go-ethereum-dao` and
`parity-ethereum-dao` are frozen AT the fork; this is the whole client at its final state, so it
carries the DAO fork implementation and seven more years besides. 19 files at this ref carry DAO
fork handling, `libethashseal/genesis/mainNetwork.cpp` and `libethcore/ChainOperationParams.h`
among them.

**It has ZERO Ethereum Classic support, and is not a historic Ethereum Classic client.** Measured
at this ref: **0** files match `ethereum.?classic` or `ETCFork`, against a control search for
`ethash` that matches 80. It implemented the DAO fork and never carried the chain that declined it.
Do not file it in the client lineage above, and do not read its presence in this organization
directory as a claim that it carried this chain.

**It shares a root commit with go-ethereum, and that is NOT shared lineage.** aleth has 27 root
commits; `68ccbefc9` is one of them, and it is already reachable in this archive through
`ethereum/go-ethereum-dao`. So the standard independence check — the one that establishes
`besu-eth/besu-etc` as a third oracle and collapses `multi-geth` into core-geth's lineage — reports
a shared root here and reads as evidence that the C++ client is a geth fork. It is not. Open the
commit:

```sh
git ls-tree -r --name-only 68ccbefc9
```

**Three files** — `.gitignore`, `ethereum.js`, `index.html` — authored `obscuren`, 2014-09-30,
message `init`. It is the early JavaScript library's history, merged into both repositories, and
carries no client code in any language. A shared root is evidence of a shared *repository ancestor*
and nothing more; check what the root contains before drawing a lineage from it.

Four mode-160000 gitlinks live inside this tree — `cmake/cable`, `evmc`, `scripts/dopple`,
`test/jsontests` — and aleth carries its own `.gitmodules` for them, which git reads at no depth but
the repository root.

The Java client, and **a historic Ethereum Classic client** — the case this archive vendors whole.
`ethereumj-core/src/main/java/org/ethereum/config/blockchain/ETCFork3M.java` implements this chain's
2.5M and 3M forks, and its test asserts chain id 61. That support arrived 2017-01-16 in a commit
titled "Add ETC 2.5M and 3M forks" and **is still present at this ref.**

**Frozen at `develop`, and the freeze point was confirmed by content rather than assumed from the
default branch.** `EXTRACTION-historic-clients.md` is emphatic that the two are not the same
question — OpenEthereum removed this chain two years before its final commit, so its default branch
is not its supporting state. Here they coincide, and this is the check that says so:

```sh
git log --diff-filter=D -- '*ETCFork3M.java'
```

Empty output is the pass, and it was empty. Calibrate it against `*.java`, which returns real
deletions; a filter that can report nothing proves nothing. This is the *"repository ended while
still carrying this chain"* case that file names for `multi-geth`.

It is also **the only JVM record of this chain's early forks written while they were happening.**
`besu-eth/besu-etc` is the other JVM client here and is a far later reimplementation; ethereumj
carried Ethereum Classic contemporaneously, in the era `ETCFork3M` is named after.

**The copyright holder is not the Ethereum Foundation**, despite the `ethereum/` organization. All

# The preceding repository's client — vendored 2026-09-07

**One repository, whole, with history, frozen at a repository boundary rather than at an upstream's
death.** This upstream is alive and still committing. What ended at this ref is not the repository —
it is that repository's run as this chain's canonical client line.

`ethereumclassic/core-geth` was created on 2024-12-21 from `etclabscore/core-geth` at commit
`7ef3ecd7a` (2024-12-16), and has carried Ethereum Classic's Core-Geth since; that commit is
preserved upstream on the `archive-etclabscore-2024-12` branch and tagged
`archive/etclabscore-2024-12`. **Both repositories have committed independently from that commit
ever since**, so the preceding upstream will never again show this state except as one commit deep
inside a history that diverged from the line this archive tracks. That is what this copy holds, and
it is why the entry exists despite the upstream being in no danger.

**The boundary is enforced at the object level, not by naming a ref.** A vendoring can claim a
freeze point and still drag later history in through a branch fetch, and nothing about the working
tree would show it. This one does not — the commit of every release tag published on that upstream
after the boundary is unresolvable in this repository:

```sh
git cat-file -t 96b2afc25   # want: fatal: Not a valid object name
git cat-file -t 7ef3ecd7a   # want: commit  <- the control
```

**The negative result means something only because the positive control resolves.** Checked at
vendoring for seven post-boundary commits, including the commit behind every later release tag; all
seven were absent and the boundary commit was present.

The client that carried this chain after multi-geth, and the fourth link in the lineage above. Its
Ethereum Classic support was measured rather than assumed: 30 files match `ethereum.?classic`,
`ETCFork` or `ClassicChainConfig` at this ref, against an `ethash` control matching 302.

**This ref is NOT a release, and the tree says so.** `params/version.go` reads `1.12.21-unstable` —
six months of development past `v1.12.20` (2024-06-10), which is the last release this history
contains. The upstream tags `v1.12.21`, `v1.12.22` and `v1.12.23` all postdate the boundary and none
of them is reachable here. Do not read the vendored tree as any published version, and do not cite a
version number off it.

**Shares root commit `5db3335dc` with `multi-geth/multi-geth`, and here that IS shared lineage** —
the multi-geth entry above already records the two as one client line under two names, so the
standard independence check reports a shared root and is right to. It also shares `68ccbefc9` with
`ethereum/go-ethereum`, which is NOT lineage: that root holds the early JavaScript library's three
files, exactly as the `ethereum/aleth` entry records.

Three mode-160000 gitlinks live inside this tree — `tests/testdata`, `tests/testdata-etc` and
`tests/evm-benchmarks` — mapped in the root `.gitmodules`, because one unmapped gitlink fails
`git submodule status` for the whole repository rather than for that path alone. `tests/testdata-etc`
pins `06ec708ea7`, **the same ref this archive vendors whole at `etclabscore/tests`**, so the client
and the suite it was tested against are both held here at the ref that pairs them.

### Why the boundary is here: who funded the work, and until when

**This commit is a stewardship boundary, and the funding organization's own published record is
what dates it.** Recorded because the archive's usual test — what disappears if the upstream
vanishes — does not by itself explain why *this* commit is the freeze point.

**The ETC Cooperative funded Core-Geth development from January 2022.** Announced 2021-12-22:
*"Starting in January 2022, development work on the Core-Geth client will be funded by the ETC
Cooperative."* Isaac Ardis and Christos Ziogas signed independent contractor agreements and
continued under the ETC Core banner; Diego López León joined that team. The Cooperative funded the
work; the developers were contractors, so read "funded" rather than "employed."
<https://etccooperative.org/posts/2021-12-22-coop-now-funding-core-geth>

**That same post corroborates the client lineage this archive is ordered by, from the maintaining
team's side rather than from the repositories:** *"The ETC Core team was initially formed as ETC
Labs Core in December 2018 with many of its developers having previously been part of the ETCDEV
team which supported the Classic Geth client. As Classic Geth was retired they supported the
Multi-Geth client prior to the birth of Core-Geth in 2020."* Classic Geth, then multi-geth, then
Core-Geth — stated by the people who carried it, and matching the order of the lineage above.

**The funded era ended as the organization moved to maintenance mode, across three published
documents around this commit.**

- **2024-12-05**, eleven days before the boundary commit — the executive director's departure
  announcement, describing the client work in progress: *"After the Prophasis (v1.12.20) release,
  there has been several months of work underway to do the first merge after this removal … that
  newer version is still pending release. The core developers will be assessing possible
  alternative strategies for client software moving forward, with fresh eyes on Besu, Erigon and
  Nethermind."* <https://etccooperative.org/posts/2024-12-05-q2-q3-reports>

  **This independently confirms what the vendored tree measures.** Its last release is `v1.12.20`
  and `params/version.go` reads `1.12.21-unstable` — the "pending release" the post describes,
  still pending at the boundary eleven days later.

- **2024 Retrospective, printed page 25 of 29:** *"Without any way to obtain funding, the ETC Coop
  will be in maintenance mode, with spending minimized, until the funding runs out. At that time,
  it will be up to other stakeholders to take on any required maintenance of the ETC client, unless
  a new plan materializes."*
  <https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-retrospective-2024.pdf>

- **Q1 2025 report, printed page 13 of 17:** *"Due to significant changes in the organization, we
  are no longer comparing actual expenditures to a budget or previous years. This is because we are
  now in maintenance mode and spending has decreased significantly."*
  <https://etccooperative.org/etc-cooperative-q1-2025-en.pdf>

So the vendored range covers the funded era end to end — January 2022 to this commit, plus the
history the client carried into it — and `ethereumclassic/core-geth`, created five days later, is
where the proposal above was carried out and where "other stakeholders … take on any required
maintenance" actually happened.

**The move is proposed in the retrospective itself — and it is IMAGE content, invisible to every
text tool.** PDF page 24 (which prints "Page 18 of 29") carries a photograph of Donald McIntyre,
the Cooperative's Senior Editor, giving a talk titled "Ethereum Classic Roadmap" at the BITMAIN
World Digital Mining Summit in Muscat, Oman, 28-29 March 2024. The slide on screen behind him is
headed **"ETC Pathway Proposed by Donald McIntyre"**, and its second bullet reads:

> Move Core Geth to the Ethereum Classic community repository

**That is this boundary, proposed nine months before the commit and published by the funding
organization in its own retrospective.** The other four bullets are "Cancel MESS", backward
compatibility for the account and EVM versioning system, a supply-audit tool, and an 8 million gas
block size.

**Do not try to verify that quotation with `pdftotext`, and do not trust a text sweep that says it
is absent.** A full-text sweep of all 29 pages returns **0** matches for `ethereumclassic` and 0 for
any handoff phrasing, against controls that fire normally — `client` 9, `Core-Geth` 6, `Diego` 1.
The load-bearing sentence is pixels in a conference photo, so every text instrument reports it
missing, confidently, with a working control attached. This archive's own rule is that an absence
claim needs a corpus rather than one instrument; here one instrument covered every page and still
could not see the sentence. Render the page instead:

```sh
pdfimages -f 24 -l 24 -png etc-cooperative-retrospective-2024.pdf p24   # then open p24-000.png
```

The Cooperative's *prose* still never names `ethereumclassic/core-geth`, and no post of theirs
between 2024-10 and 2025-12 announces the transition as completed. So these sources establish the
funding era and the stated intent; the repository boundary as executed is documented by
`ethereumclassic/core-geth`'s own README and its signed `archive/etclabscore-2024-12` tag.

**Verifying the two PDF quotations: cite the printed footer, not the PDF page index.** They differ.
In the retrospective, printed page 25 is PDF page 25, but printed page 24 is PDF page **23** — PDF
page 24 prints "Page 18 of 29", one page sitting out of order. `file` also reports both documents
as 8 pages; `pdfinfo` reports 29 and 17, and is right.

**Frozen at `7ef3ecd7a` — prove it by tree hash, never by diff:**

```sh
git rev-parse '7ef3ecd7a^{tree}'
git rev-parse 'HEAD:etclabscore/core-geth'
```

Both read `29bf8ae0e7b759e68f6af107647f6ffcfcb27015` at vendoring, checked against a control —
`v1.12.20^{tree}`, which is `ed3abaab12` — confirming the comparison can report a mismatch.

Swept for blobs over 100 MiB across the whole grafted history before landing: **0 hits**, the sweep
calibrated at 1 MiB first, which returns 135. The largest blob in the history is
`tests/files/VMTests/vmInputLimits.json` at 60.3 MiB.

# Go modules the production client builds against, vendored 2026-09-13

**Two repositories, whole, with history, held on the ground `etclabscore/tests` is held on: each is a
live build dependency of the production Ethereum Classic client.** `ethereumclassic/core-geth`
requires `github.com/etclabscore/go-openrpc-reflect` `v0.0.37` directly and
`github.com/etclabscore/go-jsonschema-walk` `v0.0.6` indirectly. Its `v1.13.0-rc2` tag and the
`etclabscore/core-geth` tree vendored above both carry exactly the `go.sum` lines recorded below, and
neither names any other `github.com/etclabscore/` module. Both modules are published from the
organization the 2026-08-26 pass above records as scheduled for deprecation.

**The set is closed, and that was checked rather than assumed.** At `v0.0.37`, `go-openrpc-reflect`
requires one module from that organization, `go-jsonschema-walk` `v0.0.6`; at `v0.0.6`,
`go-jsonschema-walk` requires none.

**Mechanism:** `git subtree add` without `--squash`, from a local clone at the upstream's default
branch, as for every entry above. **Every branch and every tag upstream is reachable from that ref.**
That was read from each upstream's own `ls-remote`, not from a clone's copy of it, so one ref per
repository carries all of them, and every tagged commit resolves here and is reachable from `main`.
Pull-request refs are not branches and are not held; at vendoring, four pull-request heads on
`go-openrpc-reflect` pointed at commits outside its history.

**The tagged commits are here; the tag objects are not.** This repository carries no tag refs, and a
subtree add brings in commits, not the annotated tag objects that name them. For these two that is a
real loss, because many of the tags are PGP-signed, both pinned versions among them. Each entry's tag
map therefore records every tag's object ID beside its commit, so a tag recovered from any other copy
can be checked against the one upstream published.

**In both entries the vendored tree is NOT the pinned version.** Each upstream committed past the tag
the client pins, so `HEAD:etclabscore/<repo>` is the default branch, and the pinned version is an
older commit in the grafted history. Each entry names that commit and what lies between.

### Verifying a pinned version from this repository alone

The tree hash proves a vendored default branch is upstream's. It says nothing about a pinned version;
**the module hash does**, computed from this repository's object store and never from GitHub. Run from
the repository root:

```sh
C=ba5a99fa846de681b412765a38a3fb11b0016208 M=github.com/etclabscore/go-openrpc-reflect V=v0.0.37
W=$(mktemp -d)
git init -q --bare "$W/src.git"
git -C "$W/src.git" fetch -q "$PWD" "$C"
git -C "$W/src.git" update-ref "refs/tags/$V" "$C"
git config -f "$W/gitconfig" url."file://$W/src.git".insteadOf "https://$M"
git config -f "$W/gitconfig" protocol.file.allow always
(cd "$W" && GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL="$W/gitconfig" GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1 \
  GOPROXY=direct GOSUMDB=off GOFLAGS=-modcacherw GOMODCACHE="$W/modcache" \
  go mod download -json "$M@$V")
```

`Sum` and `GoModSum` must equal the entry's table, and `Origin.Hash` names the commit the zip was
built from. `GOPROXY=direct` makes the Go toolchain fetch from the source repository itself, and the
redirect makes that source this repository. **Then move the tag to the previous
version's commit and run it again. The hashes must change**; if they do not, the check is reading from
somewhere other than this repository.

Verified 2026-09-13 with go1.26.6: both pinned versions reproduce both of their hashes, and both
controls change them. An independent SHA-256 dirhash, computed straight from the git blobs with no Go
toolchain involved, agrees on every value, the controls included.

Generates OpenRPC service descriptions from Go code by reflection. `ethereumclassic/core-geth`
imports it in `node/` for RPC discovery.

**`master` is one commit past the pinned version**, and that commit touches `go.mod` and `go.sum`
only: the `go` directive rises from 1.13 to 1.21, and the indirect requirements are listed in full in a
block of their own, with no direct requirement changing version. **Read `ba5a99fa8` for what the
client builds, not the vendored tree.**

Upstream carries no `v0.0.28`; its tags skip from `v0.0.27` to `v0.0.29`. Its one branch besides
`master`, `fix-m1-nil-pointer`, is merged, and `v0.0.37` is the first tag that contains it. That tag's
message reads *"fix for Apple Silicon M1 bug"*.

# The WMI fork the production client compiles into Windows builds, vendored 2026-09-13

**One repository, whole, with history, held on the ground the two Go modules above are held on: it
is compiled into the production Ethereum Classic client.** `ethereumclassic/core-geth` requires
`github.com/yusufpapurcu/wmi` `v1.2.4` as an indirect dependency, at its `v1.13.0-rc2` tag, with the
`go.sum` lines recorded below. It arrives through `github.com/shirou/gopsutil`, which core-geth
imports in `metrics/` and `cmd/utils/`. At the `v3.21.11+incompatible` core-geth requires, gopsutil
carries no root `go.mod` and imports the fork from its Windows sources, `cpu/cpu_windows.go`,
`host/host_windows.go` and `internal/common/common_windows.go`, which is why core-geth's own `go.mod`
lists it. Only Windows builds compile it.

**It is a fork on a personal GitHub account, and its original is archived.** The repository is a
GitHub fork of `github.com/StackExchange/wmi`, which its organization has archived. Holding the fork
here takes the personal account out of the build's source.

**Verify the pinned version with the recipe in "Verifying a pinned version from this repository
alone" above**, substituting:

```sh
C=6c94d732ac31d45ca1f62731b1682157ce85e224 M=github.com/yusufpapurcu/wmi V=v1.2.4
```

Verified 2026-09-13 with go1.26.6: `v1.2.4` reproduces both hashes below, moving the tag to
`v1.2.3`'s commit changes them, and the independent dirhash over the git blobs agrees on every value.

**Here the vendored tree IS the pinned version**, unlike the two Go modules above: `master` and
`v1.2.4` name the same commit.

**A pseudo-version for this commit is `v0.0.0-20240128142943-6c94d732ac31`**, from its commit time in
UTC and its first twelve hex digits; `cmd/go` derives the same string from the commit when no tag is
present. The commit's own tree has the module at its root, as upstream published it. The
`yusufpapurcu/wmi/` directory exists only in this repository's commits.

Its `go.mod` at `v1.2.4` requires one module, `github.com/go-ole/go-ole` `v1.2.6`, published by an
organization rather than a personal account. `master` is the only branch upstream, and the map below
covers every tag. Pull-request refs are not held; at vendoring, four pull-request heads pointed at
commits outside its history.
